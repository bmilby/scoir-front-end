# User Login Code Challenge

This project uses the [React](https://reactjs.org/) JavaScript framework to create a simple login screen that allows users to enter their username(email) and password and authenticate the login form with a [GoLang](https://go.dev/) backend API service.

## How-To

1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
1. In the root folder of `scoir-front-end` execute the command `npm start` this will start the front end applicaton
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Assumptions

1. User is already created in the database
1. Valid credentials:
   - email: admin@example.com
   - password: secret
1. Use firefox browser because chrome is not allowing cookies to be set from localhost `http` protocol
